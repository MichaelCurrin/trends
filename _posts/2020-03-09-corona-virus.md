## Google Trends graphs

Graphs I created around the topic and have embedded here. Each includes a link to the original graph on Google Trends - especially useful for seeing additional data such as map of countries, which cannot be embedded.

### Coronavirus worlwide in 2020

This graph includes the _Coronavirus_ topic which seems to have much higher volume than any explored topics or phrases. There are lot of ways people express this and this seems to cover the concept well.

As phrases, "covid" is used more than "covid-19", plus there are some other areas that are lower volume and not shown, including a SARS virus topic.

### Coronavirus cases 2020

People did searches relating to case of coronavirus. There are much lower volume than the _Coronavirus_ topic itself but still useful to look at - especially when looking at the country map on Google Trends itself.

### Coronavirus vs holidays over the last 5 years

The Coronavirus has received more attention in Google search volume than the previous Christmas Day and some other major  annual international events.

### Quarantine

As the virus spreads, people and countries started implementing quantines, lockdowns and "social distancing" to contain the pandemic.

However, the attention to those topics is significantly lower than for the _Coronavirus_ topic, shown below for comparison.
